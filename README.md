# Shopping Cart 

### Project Description: 

I have developed a shopping cart web application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This user-friendly website offers a range of functionalities to enhance the shopping experience. With a seamless interface and intuitive design, users can easily add or remove products, dynamically update prices, calculate subtotals, apply taxes, and determine the grand total.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to manage their shopping activities. By leveraging the power of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the application offers a responsive and interactive interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

### Key Features:

𝟏) 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Users can browse through a catalog of available products and add them to their shopping cart with a simple click. They can also remove products from the cart if needed.

𝟐) 𝐃𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: As users add or remove products, the website automatically updates the prices accordingly. This real-time calculation ensures that customers have an accurate view of the total cost as they modify their selection.

𝟑) 𝐒𝐮𝐛𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The web application calculates the subtotal by adding up the prices of the selected products. This feature allows users to keep track of their expenses before applying taxes.

𝟒) 𝐓𝐚𝐱 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: A 10% tax is applied to the subtotal to determine the final cost. By automatically calculating the tax amount, users are presented with an inclusive price that includes all applicable taxes.

𝟓) 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: After adding the tax percentage to the subtotal, the application calculates the grand total. This final amount reflects the total cost, including the tax, enabling users to have a clear understanding of their overall expenses.

The shopping cart web application has been designed with a focus on user experience and ease of use. The responsive layout ensures compatibility across various devices, allowing users to shop conveniently from desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.

Future enhancements may include integrating payment gateways to facilitate seamless transactions, implementing user authentication for personalized shopping experiences, and expanding the product catalog with additional categories and filters.

Overall, this shopping cart web application provides a user-friendly and dynamic platform for managing online purchases. By leveraging the capabilities of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the website empowers users to effortlessly add or remove products, calculate prices, and obtain a clear understanding of their shopping expenses.
